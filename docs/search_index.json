They advocate for Git Flow in all workflows. 2.2 2021-10-06 Trevor Riley of the NOAA library and I talked about 508 compliance and NOAA citations. Typically, when a NOAA librarian helps you with a document they recommend Cite While You Write combined with EndNote. The NOAA library is working on getting a single, integrated Endnote library but this is not currently available. Instead, they have Endnote libraries from individual projects. 2.2.1 Institutional Repository All NOAA funded and NOAA published documents are supposed to be entered into the Institutional Repository The goal is to get all entries starting from 2015 to current year. They will accept entries from any year though. The Institutional Repository uses NOAA resources to check metadata and assign a DOI. Assigning a DOI to all stock assessment documents would facilitate cataloging them. RIS file could be batch downloaded and converted to a bib file. Everything in the repository should be 508 compliant and is checked internally using a standard. Jamie works on compliance issues every day and Jennifer has a good handle on it. Their guidance is summarized in the Quick Start Big 5 list. send .bib file to Trevor look at the link that Trevor sent to find how many assessments are actually in the institutional repository 2.2.2 EndNote library 200 projects 60 species and projects outside of species research all archived libraries from different projects goal is to bring it into a single repository that could be shared starting with Endangered Species Act work do not manually check information from a publisher or tell publishers when information is incorrect 2.2.2.1 Import of bib file to EndNote Trevor tried importing the Lingcod.bib file from the 2021 assessment and no metadata was found. I did a quick google search and found that Imperial College London has advice on LaTeX with EndNote with filters that are needed to import .bib entries. Even with these filters, the ability of EndNote to recognize metadata is not great. 2.3 2021-09-17 2.3.1 Z{\"o}ller et al.Â 2020 As the workforce turns more towards remote work, decisions are becoming more local (Capra and Luisi, 2016). FLOSS-based groups are becoming more like a bazaar, structured horizontally and maintained by modular self-organized teams without central management, rather than a cathedral, e.g., Linux and Fetchmail. Schrape (2018) suggest that with corporate influence in FLOSS there are four types of open source projects, Corporate-led collaboration projects characterized by clear hierarchies, Hierarchical infrastructure projects that are largely run by nonprofits with horizontal structures, Elite-centered project communities that are hierarchical centered around a few core developers, and Egalitarian oriented peer production communities that maintain horizontal structure. The onion model suggests that newcomers move through the ranks by Contributing to bug fixes, documentation, small feature improvements, and discussion; Eventually becoming a core developer and contributing to pull requests. Pull requests dictate the groups hierarchy. Small groups (3-7) are the primary settings for socialization, skill transfer, and the delegation of duties (Snow et al., 1986). Medium-sized groups (8-20) allow complex interdependent coordination. Decentralized groups perform better on complex tasks than centralized groups. More centralized communication patterns developed in groups that performed simple discrete tasks. Goal settings and quality control are important group functions that require establishing a decision process. Resilient projects have complex structure with more than one person accepting pull requests. These complex groups maintained contributors and were more productive than star-shaped groups with a single person designated to accept pull requests. Sharing information publicly reduces the burden of coordination creating less logistical overhead. 2.4 2021-08-16 2.4.1 Thesis Chapter 1 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12188 https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/77/7-8/2529/5912155#223391660 https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Estimation-and-classification-of-temporal-trends-to-Solvang-Planque/5f5727f6f2b3512ee5d9dc2e1258a7c75ed02ded https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-simulation-study-of-trend-detection-methods-for-Hardison-Perretti/c679d003c94b70d587fa9be62f8a11911dc7944b#citing-papers https://github.com/nwfsc-timeseries/tvvarss::simTVVAR.R https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/arima.sim https://github.com/seanhardison1/soe_simulations/blob/master/R/sim_function.R https://github.com/kellijohnson-NOAA/tsrelation/blob/master/R/tvvarss_simTVVAR.R https://github.com/fate-ewi/bayesdfa::sim.R https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019/RJ-2019-007/index.html 2.4.2 Hake recruitment https://github.com/seanhardison1/soe_simulations/blob/master/R/sim_function.R 2.5 2021-06-10 2.5.1 Rstudio community talk - Building Effective Data Science Teams 2.5.1.1 Prioritization You will only ever have time to do 10% of the work. Therefore, it is important to have a list of tasks that are clearly defined and when a new task comes in it must be prioritized against the current list. Looking at a new task relative to the current list is important because if you want to work on the newly added task, then something else will need to be moved down the list. 2.6 2021-06-03 2.6.1 utils::file_test Check if a file is a directory or file and if it exists or not. You can also test if a file is newer than or older than another file. I found this function while perusing the bookdown::render_book function. It is used inside of an if statement, where the check is saved to an object, something I did not know how to do. I always thought you had to save it outside and then test it. For example, if (!all(exist &lt;- file_test(&quot;-f&quot;, input))) { stop(&quot;Some files were not found: &quot;, paste(input[!exist], collapse = &#39; &#39;)) } 2.6.2 Openscapes The openscapes training that Eric Ward set up helped to validate my workflow, which has been a great productivity generator for me because it often seemed like I was wasting time organizing and using such rigid standards. It is NOT a waste of time. Helping my future self not hate my job is legitimate. Yesterday, I got feedback from PEP on my talk about sa4ss for the L-team. The previous day I got feedback from KM on the same talk. Both experiences were helpful. I learned that the more organized you are and the better the story of your first and last slides are, the better the information will be received. 2.6.3 R desc The desc package helps to read, parse, and edit DESCRIPTION files. desc::desc_get_dps(file = \"\") provides a list of all dependencies in the DESCRIPTION file for a given package passed to file. 2.6.4 Pacific hake otolith exchange Exchange of 100 otoliths with DFO 2.6.4.1 Timing Exchange fish from a single year. Fish from early in the year are harder to age because the annulus isnt as defined. Age readers often do fine when they know when the fish was landed because they can correct their read for the timing. Survey ages will be coming to the lab later this year because of covid protocols that delay the timing of things. 2.6.4.2 Bottom trawl survey are harder to read The ages from the bottom trawl survey for hake are hard to read. They are patchy and faint. Not recommended for a beginning reader. genetic testing of hake fin clips from the two different surveys, midwater versus bottom trawl. 2.6.4.3 Alternative methods for younger fish Fish length, otolith weight, spectroscopy,  Large year classes are hard to age when there are lots of little fish. Plot length distribution of age reads across years to see how consistent they are. 2.7 2021-05-29 2.7.1 Confidence intervals When working with R, you can find the confidence interval of an estimate that is assumed to have a normal distribution using the stats package. crit &lt;- stats::qnorm( p = 1 - (1 - 0.95) / 2, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE ) print(crit) ## [1] 1.959964 will find the z score that is associated with a 95% confidence interval. One can change the value of 0.95 to any value between zero and one. This z-score is then multiplied by the standard error and both subtracted and added to the estimate to give a confidence interval. You can also multiply it by the standard deviation, but for small sample sizes the standard deviation needs to be corrected for sample size. 2.7.2 keywords confidence interval statistics 2.8 2021-05-27 2.8.1 Lingcod CARE Mark Terwilliger (California): they do not age their own lingcod fins but they do process them WDFW ages commercial samples, just under 1200 fins Laurel Lam aged sport samples, 260 samples per year, Mark Terwilliger is also currently ageing more sport fishery samples as we speak, he taught himself from looking at Laurels; also doing a second read on some structures that Laurel read black rockfish at the SWFSC is their bread and butter and there is no way that the SWFSC could age both lingcod and black rockfish at the same time Josie Thompson started looking into using otoliths in 2009 and 2010 (n = 100) to do double reads but nothing came of the study Nikki Paige (Newport) 2008 and back 100 percent aged, since then 2009 only half are aged 300 paired otolith samples, 2016 and 2017 survey data, they will be scanned as well as aged via break and burn, 2020 was 2000 fins doesnt use the metal mesh binder clips, instead they use foam mats and pins Andrew Claiborne (WDFW) started production ageing in 2000 port-samples do the fin-ray prep considered otoliths 3-4 years ago (n = 119), surface age on otolith because the otoliths get noisy as you go south, underageing relative to fin rays for the older fish, 5 year old fins appear as 10 year old otolith fish, older fish were fine, another couple hundred of pairs are available; like sablefish, if you only look at break and burn reads will be off but surface reads will help guide break and burn reads; Stephen Wischniowski 400-450 per year, 2021 == 1500 b/c they are behind, only age fin rays currently sampling oldest and youngest fish to do a comparison study Kevin McNeel (SE Alaska) fishers only return sampled fish getting sex data along with otolith data is important Chris Hinds (ADF&amp;G ADU) use otoliths must use nail laqeur b/c they cannot get toxic material b/c there are no roads 2.9 2021-05-26 2.9.1 Steering committee Mix of federal and external participants. 2.9.2 Cole Monnahan Regarding how prioritizing is going to happen? Should we have a spreadsheet with each stock and their requirements. Rick responded with there is a start to that in SIS because it records basic information such as what model it is using. Christine responded with Stock SMART or peer-reviewed manuscripts could be helpful. Stock Smart has information on any stock that has an FMP. As of 2019, 50 assessments are in SIS are VPA and 62 are SCAA according to StockSMART. 2.10 2021-05-26 2.10.1 Rethink Reporting with Automation by Claudio Rebelo and RStudio presentation 2.10.1.1 Abstract Companies struggle with reporting. Specifically, theyre caught in a cycle of inefficient and error-prone workflows that: Place a burden on individual data scientists when reports need to be repeated, updated, or shared. Prevent decision-makers and business users from getting important, accurate insights in a timely manner. Resulting in enormous amounts of resources (people, tools, time) are invested into delivering a mediocre product to stakeholders, reports that are uninspiring to consume, slow to produce, and potentially not accurate. On May 26th, we invite you to join Claudio Rebelo, Actuary at Swiss Re, to learn about how companies in every industry, but especially in insurance, can revolutionize their reporting capabilities with automation. Youll learn about his teams journey transitioning from a reporting frankenstack, involving SAS, Excel, and SQL, to a more effective way with free, open-source tools like R Markdown. The goal is to inspire you to think about what could be possible when it comes to reporting within your own organization, with just a little bit of effort. Youll get a high-level overview of Claudio and Swiss Res journey, along with concrete tactical tips on how to use tools like R Markdown more effectively. If youre a team-lead or business user without much experience with R, youll learn: The consequences associated with traditional, messy reporting workflows. The benefits of automation when it comes to reporting. How to incorporate open-source tools like R Markdown into a corporate environment. If youre a data scientists already experienced with R and R Markdown youll learn: How to enhance your reporting with Shiny and parameterized reports. How to automate QA and collaboration tasks, like commenting. About new packages for specific tasks. If youre a data scientists already experienced with R, but not automating reports with tools like R Markdown We hope this presentation inspires you to start ASAP! 2.10.1.2 About the speaker Claudio Rebelo / Actuary at Swiss Re Claudio Rebelo is an Actuary at Swiss Re in Zurich, Switzerland, where he has worked in reserving, pricing and currently model validation, having over 12 years of experience in the insurance industry. With a keen interest in insurance data visualization he is also involved, at Swiss Re, in the implementation of automated reporting solutions with R Markdown. 2.10.1.3 R packages DT: searchable tables glue kable plotly officer 2.10.1.4 Bookdown Can create word documents.

LaTeX community is declining. Tinytex is positive because it is bringing in the next generation. Jonathan Fine is seen as a trouble-maker within the LaTeX community because he gets heated when he believes things are wrong. LaTex community believes that people should put up with the pain because it is best that is out there. The core of TeX users are mathematicians and physicists, certain batches of other fields that are highly mathematical. Group of people without much in common other than typsetting, so no shared purpose. 5.1.1.2 Resources More of a distance between the users and developers tex.stackexchange help pages Learn LaTeX project TeX book - search for tex book 3 .bib TeX by Examples Mathematical TeX by Example George Gretzer, More Math into LaTex cookbook built on examples built on examples latex mailing list is low-volume and doesnt do much issue trackers for particular projects TeX act mailing list google the error message, which normally leads to stackexchange post to tex news groups news groups arose before there were search engines taking too many hours a day to keep up with them google groups is one of the worst news readers out there German tex news group usenet - doesnt run on any one place, ntp servers, text only comp.text.tex - in the 1990s this was the stackexchange of its day FAQ CTAN sends an announcement to this user group for each time a package is submitted comp.lang.python mathematics stack exchange - use mathjax have a big help page that is viewed a large number of times help documents or technical documents users tend to use the same packages that they have used before Timescale for getting the package changed is quite long. Most journals do not actually use LaTeX themselves, so the motivation to maintain the packages is not high. SML and other formats are what publishers actually use. When TeX started it was a typesetting program. Journals required typesetting back then. Standardization and uniformity were key. Reproducibility is important if you have collaborators. Python is moving to the top three because of data science. Python community has crusty people in it. Elm community is the nicest. 5.1.1.3 Different versions of TeX Unicode support is hard but needed. Luatex and ctex extended TeX to allow for multiple writing directions. TeX or pdfTeX doesnt have the interface to create characters. Hans et al.Â that are part of the contex community, the Dutch market thought it was critical to have illustrative content. Every document that is worth writing is worth designing. Where traditionally, TeX was more cookbook style. Luatex is a close to being a standalone system. One cannot combine all of the goals into a single platform. Originally, TeX was majorly focused on reproducibility. Four different rendering systems that produce different output given input. Unicode has a new addition every year or two. 5.1.1.4 The Stories of English Until the advent of dictionaries there was not an agreement. It did not bother people that there were differences. Dictionaries led to standardized grammar and spelling. Even if you try to lay down rules, new words show up and it is difficult to decide how to deal with new entries. Difficult to come up with any standards that will be valid for a length of time. If we can keep software running and licensed that is the real limiting factor. Publishers really need to develop virtual machines to set up typesetting environments that will continue to typeset the documents well into the future. 5.1.2 2021-06-10 5.1.2.1 Question I have Should we worry about making pdfs accessible or should we be moving to html that can be printed to pdf.

Self voicing will compete with the screen reader, such as JAWS or NV Access. Someone who doesnt have the benefit of having a screen reader on their machine still might need help. Lots of people have problems with reading, such as dyslexia or light sensitivity. Using ARIA you can control the voicing of the screen reader but it takes extra effort in how the web page is coded. Here is an example of self voicing from Brian Richwine. 5.1.2.3.3 Blind math BlindMath Blind Math list for those interested in mathematics 5.1.2.3.4 DAISY DAISY Accessible Publishing Database 5.1.2.3.5 E-pub Moving towards e-pub in academia rather than pdf. 5.1.2.3.6 pdf An interchange enabler to bridge different platforms. pdf is a page-description language as much as dvi is a page-description language. pdf can be structured with comments but it not essentially a way of conveying that information. Whereas, html can provide context to the meaning of the string of words. pdf has built-in limitations. pdf is not in-of itself a solution for accessibility.
