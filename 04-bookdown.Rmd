# bookdown

## Render book to local machine

```{r bookdown-render, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")
```

## Output

### html

### pdf

To compile this example to PDF,
you need XeLaTeX.
Installing [TinyTeX](https://yihui.name/tinytex/),
which includes XeLaTeX,
is recommended.

## Warnings

Remember each .Rmd file contains one and only one chapter,
and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
If the previous is not true,
then R will warn the user that the number of files does not match the number of headers.
The warning can be ignored.
For example,

> You have 5 Rmd input file(s) but only 4 first-level heading(s). Did you forget first-level headings in certain Rmd files?
